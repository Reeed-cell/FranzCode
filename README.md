# ⚡ FranzCode 
**"The programming language built for chaos."**

FranzCode is a custom-built, interpreted language designed for simplicity and expressive (sometimes loud) syntax. It features a full pipeline: Lexer -> Parser (AST) -> Interpreter.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* **Python 3.8+** must be installed on your system.

### Installation

#### Linux / macOS
1. Open your terminal in the FranzCode directory.
2. Run the installer script:
   ```bash
   bash install.sh
This will make the franz command available globally. If you don't want to use the installer, you can run:
chmod +x franz
./franz demo.franz

Windows:
1. Open the "Edit the system environment variables" menu in Windows.
2. Add the path to your franzcode folder to the Path variable.
3. You can now use the franz command in CMD or PowerShell

🛠 Usage
Interactive REPL
Type franz with no arguments to enter the interactive shell:
franz
>>> SET x TO 10
>>> SAY "{x} is the value"

Running a File
Create a file named hello.franz:
SET greeting TO "Hello World"
SAY greeting

Run it using:
franz hello.franz

Debugging Tools
1. View Tokens: franz --tokens file.franz (See how the lexer breaks down your code).
2. View AST: franz --ast file.franz (See the tree structure generated by the parser).
